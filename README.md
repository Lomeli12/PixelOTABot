PixelOTABot
===========

A Mastodon bot that toots everytime an OTA for a Pixel device is released.

Â 

Why does this exist?
--------------------

For those of us who (like me) root our phones and longer get automatic OTAs and
have to manually look them up and manually flash them. This should help with the
former and tell us as soon as an OTA is out.
